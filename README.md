“PROJECT PROPOSAL OF DISCRETE MATHEMATICS” 
PROJECT NAME:
“RSA Cryptography”
SOFTWARE LANGUAGE:
“C#(C sharp)”
PROJECT DETAILS & FEATURES:
In This project we present you the encryption and decryption according to the coding in which encryption is done by public key and once a messaged has been done than it decrypt it by private key.
PRIVATE KEY DETAILS:
RSA key is a private key based on RSA algorithm. Private Key is used for authentication and a symmetric key.

ALGORITHM:
•	RSA algorithm is a popular exponentiation in a finite field over integers including prime numbers.
•	The integers used by this method are sufficiently large making it difficult to solve.
•	There are two sets of keys in this algorithm: private key and public key.
